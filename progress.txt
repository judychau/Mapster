-Got json response and working on seed.py

May 19, 2015
- Worked on api URL in seed.py
-Wrote a funtion for the following to get the details api url:
	-Need to extract placeid from the Place Search api because the Place Details api requires that placeid to get the json
	-required: https://developers.google.com/places/webservice/search#TextSearchRequests
	-required: https://developers.google.com/places/webservice/details
-Turns out I do not need a seed.py file and I can just link through the db with server.py and form

>>>>extract placeid from the Place Search api because the Place Details api requires that placeid to get the json<<<
Do i even need this? lets keep it basic first and see if i need details later...

def gmaps_data():
    query='' #request.form.(name of place)

    GMAPS_KEY=os.environ['gmaps_key']
    search_url= 'https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/textsearch/json?query=%s&key=%s' %query %gmaps_key

    api_data = requests.get(search_url)
    data = api_data.json()

    for item in data ['results']:
        placeid = item['place_id']
        placedetails = requests.get('https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/place/details/json?placeid=%s&key=%s' %placeid %gmaps_key)
        data = placedetails.json()

May 22, 2015
-Kristine helped me re organized my api function into two functions: 
    1. gmaps_results: use user input and put it in the query parameter of api url to display data results in gmaps_data.html
    2. gmaps_request: json results from api url
-Got all my data to display by moving my "for loop" into my html instead of my server
-Working on saving one marker by passing the info in the form of a link AND using AJAX (currently working on the AJAX part)

May 23, 2015
-Finished up my model.py with only data I need from gmaps, will add more to it later when I integrate more api's
